Using your own WordPress site, aggregate a social timeline of your favourite sites from across the Web and then view and reply to your feeds using a [Microsub client](https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Clients).


## Description

Yarns Microsub Server helps you follow feeds from across the Web. Enter a website and Yarns will help you find and subscribe to its feed(s) in several different formats (Microformats, RSS, Atom, JSONFeed). Once you've added feeds, new posts are collected in the background for you to read whenever you want.

Rather than viewing posts in Yarns itself, you can choose among [several different apps](https://indieweb.org/Microsub#Clients) to follow your feeds on your desktop or mobile device.

No matter which app you choose to view your feed, your replies will be posted on your own website.

Accompanied by other plugins that support [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) standards, Yarns can help use your personal website as the centre of your online identity.
